What makes Hylead Survival unique?
🌎 Wild World: Explore an incredible landscape filled with custom biomes, animals, and unique structures.
🎣🍳 Advanced Mechanics: Dive into immersive systems like custom fishing and a realistic cooking engine. You can prepare custom meals and surprise your friends! You can also relax for a while and catch some new fish that we've added!
🍄 Seamless Design: Professional menus with Minecraft UI style, high-fidelity textures, and custom sounds that blend perfectly with the vanilla experience.
🎒 Custom Gear: Enhance your look and utility with high-quality 3D Backpacks, custom items, new tools and swords.
🐘 Custom Fauna: The map feels alive thanks to a variety of custom animals and unique mobs with custom sounds. We've added over 100 new animals and variants to bring more life to the world. You'll see everything from savanna fauna, with powerful elephants, lions, hyenas, crocodiles, hippos, buffalo, giraffes, and zebras, to the icy, extinct megafauna of the tundra, with colossal mammoths, woolly rhinos, Neanderthals, saber-toothed cats, and more!  (Addon required)
🦖 Dino Science: Besides surviving, you can research and clone dinosaurs to inhabit your world. You can revive extinct animals like the T-Rex and Spinosaurus using special machines! We've also added other dinosaurs such as the Velociraptor, Titanosaurus, Purussaurus, Beelzebufo, and Triceratops. You can revive them by searching for DNA in resin clumps and then inseminating a sniffer egg to unleash an ancient roar! And guess what? THEY'RE TAMEABLE (Addon required)
☠️ Dangerous Dungeons: Test your skills in treacherous dungeons filled with loot, bosses and lore.  (Addon required)
▶️ Setup & Compatibility
⛏️ What Minecraft version does the setup use? 
Hylead Survival runs natively on Paper 1.21.11, ensuring the best performance and latest features.
📱 Is the setup Bedrock compatible? 
Absolutely! Crossplay is included in the base package. Players can join from any device (PC, Console, or Mobile) without any additional purchases.
Note: Use the same port as java for Bedrock connections on our test server.
👹 I’m having visual issues on Bedrock Edition. 
If textures look off, try clearing your cached resource packs: Main Menu -> Settings -> Storage -> Cached Data -> Delete all Hylead-related packs.
If some models are invisible, but others are, remove the Geyser resource pack cache: /plugins\Geyser-Spigot\extensions\geysermodelengineextension\ResourcePack
If you are unable to see any entities, NPCs, or models, the problem is an outdated geyerutils file. Update it manually or request setup updates: 
/plugins\Geyser-Spigot\extensions\geyserutils-geyser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/plugins\geyserutils-spigot.jar

🔧 Configuration & Requirements
🛠️ Does this setup require manual configuration?
 Hylead Survival is designed to be a "ready-to-go" experience. The only manual step required is the initial installation of dependencies; we provide direct links for all of these in our installation guide to make the process as quick and painless as possible. Once those are in place, just start the server and you're ready to play!
We offer an installation add-on, where we will install the server on your hosting with free dependencies just once; if we need a premium one, you will have to provide it yourself.
⚙️ How much control do I have over configuration and translation?
 At Hylead Studios, we prioritize flexibility. Our setup is built with a highly modular architecture, allowing you to fine-tune virtually every mechanic and feature to match your vision. Furthermore, Hylead Survival is 100% localization-ready; every menu, message, and custom system can be effortlessly translated into your preferred language to cater to your specific community.
🤑 Are there any premium dependencies required? 
The core Hylead Survival setup is fully functional using only free plugins. However, please note:
Addons: Certain optional addons may require premium plugins like ModelEngine to function.
Premium Enhancements: We offer out-of-the-box support for premium plugins such as TAB, Citizens, UltimateShop, and MythicMobs. While these can enhance your server, they are entirely optional—the setup works perfectly using their free alternatives.
🎨 Which resource managers are supported? 
While Hylead Survival is fully compatible with ItemsAdder, Oraxen, and Nexo, none of them are required! We provide a standalone Vanilla Resource Pack included in the setup. This allows your players to experience all the custom content, models, and textures perfectly without needing any additional resource manager plugin. If you do prefer to use one, our assets are designed for easy merging and total flexibility.
💻 What are the hardware requirements?
CPU: A modern processor (+3.6 GHz).
RAM: A minimum of 6 GB is required for a smooth experience.  +12 GB Recommended
Hosting: We strongly suggest Dedicated Hosting over shared hosting to ensure stability.
